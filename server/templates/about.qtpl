      <p>
        You are looking at a <b>code browser</b> for <b>{{project}}</b>.
      </p>

      <p>
        By using this web interface, you can navigate the source code of <b>{{project}}</b> by <b>following simple links</b>, <b>search it</b> by using the box in the navigation bar, or use <b>vi inspired</b> key bindings to move within files.
      </p>

      <p>
        It should all be pretty intuitive, but to get started, here are a few things you may want to try:
        <ul>
          <li>Search for files or symbols by using <b>'f'</b>, <b>'s'</b> or the pull down menu to the left of the search box.</li>
          <li>Press <b>'?'</b> to have a help screen with key bindings, and <b>'a'</b> or <b>ESC</b> to <b>hide this screen</b>.</li>
          <li>Try to drag variables or functions to get more details about them.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

        This site was generated via <b>sbexr</b>, which uses <a href="http://llvm.org">LLVM</a> and <a href="http://clang.llvm.org">clang</a> to parse and index the code.

        <b>sbexr</b> is free software (as in "free speech"), under heavy development. <a href="http://sbexr.rabexc.org">sbexr.rabexc.org</a> and the Linux kernel source code are used as a playground to test new features, observe bugs, and gather feedback. Check there often if you want to see new features in action.

        As of today, the best way to know more about the project or participate in the development is to <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/sbexr/join">join the mailing list</a>.
