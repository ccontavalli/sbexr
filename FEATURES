LXR:

problems:

  - "defined in file ..."
    considers forward declarations as well
    as real definitions.

  - variable links
    find all variables with the same name
    does not understand scoping


important features:

  - understand scope of variables.
    Specifically:
      - function variables, show where that variable is used.
      - struct attributes, show where that struct attribute is used.
      - global variables, show where those globals are used.

  - understand function pointers use and invocation.
    Given a function pointer, is able to tell where that is invoked.
    Or given a function pointer, is able to tell which functions it
    may invoke.

  - distinguishes between forward declarations and not.

  - understands macros.

  - can tell where a variable is modified.
  
  - syntax coloring.
  - cut and paste without line numbers getting in the way.
